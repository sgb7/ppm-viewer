  Milestone 4 Reflection

	So right off the bat I’ll say I didn’t complete this, for two main reasons. First, I didn’t manage to figure out the blur, 
  pixelate and rotate 90 effects in milestone 3, and still wasn’t able to here, though not for lack of trying. Second, with it 
  being the end of the semester, I’ve had to allocate more time towards other things, so I couldn’t give this project as much 
  attention as I would’ve liked.
	I also wasn’t able to get flip vertically working on this milestone, because the way I did it last time just didn’t work with
  the code set up in milestone 4. After several different attempts I decided to put it aside and come back later, and then 
  didn’t get a chance to come back later. So yeah, it’s one of those things I guess. I was able to get ten of the effects 
  running okay, at the very least.
	Other than all that, I enjoyed this milestone. In all my previous versions of this project I never used the class Pixel, and 
  I have to say I like it a lot better. Overall it just seems cleaner and more efficient, and was fun to put into use. Also, I 
  loved the whole window pop-up thing, because it made it so much easier to see if my code was working alright. Working with 
  fltk in general was just a neat experience, really.
